---

A crate designed to provide a more ergonomic interface to the `pprof` crate.

Only supports Unix-like systems. This crate will have be empty on Windows.

## Example

```rust,no_run
// Create a new CPU profiler with a sampling frequency of 1000 Hz and an empty ignore list.
let cpu = scuffle_pprof::Cpu::new::<String>(1000, &[]);

// Capture a pprof profile for 10 seconds.
// This call is blocking. It is recommended to run it in a separate thread.
let capture = cpu.capture(std::time::Duration::from_secs(10)).unwrap();

// Write the profile to a file.
std::fs::write("capture.pprof", capture).unwrap();
```

## Analyzing the profile

The resulting profile can be analyzed using the [`pprof`](https://github.com/google/pprof) tool.

For example, to generate a flamegraph:

```sh
pprof -svg capture.pprof
```
